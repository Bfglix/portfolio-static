        "I joined the PhD program in the Faculty of Engineering Product Development, where for four years conducted research on navigation algorithms for outdoor robotic systems. These algorithms were implemented and deployed across multiple robotic platforms. The resulting work was documented and disseminated through several peer-reviewed publications authored by me in collaboration with other researchers from SUTD. Each project I was involved in was funded by Singaporean government organizations as the National Robotics Programme."
